/*
      View: SalesPlan1.1
      Purpose: This view is a union of THD Sales, THD Sales Plan, QC Sales Current Year, QC Sales Last Year, and QC Sales Plan. 
      The goal is to create a unioned view of all sales numbers and create further calculations in Tableau.

      ChangeLog: 
        Change:  Added sustainable date joins (i.e. not relying on "-1").
        Author: SJL
        Change Date: 2/12/2019 
        Change:  Added subdept, where available. Fixed all subdepts so that there are no leading zeros.
